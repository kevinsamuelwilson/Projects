[project report](Post_College_Earnings_Prediction.pdf)

We used data from the US Department of Education [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) and several regression methods including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees, to (1) better predict the expected earnings of graduates from each college in the dataset and (2) identify the characteristics of a college that are most predictive in determining post-college earnings. We found that graduates from universities that (1) granted more STEM degrees, (2) had lower student dropout rates, and (3) reported higher average faculty salaries, had higher earnings than graduates from other universities.
In order to run the notebooks, download the data from College Scorecard above and placed the CSVS with names like `MERGED2004_05_PP.csv` into the `data` folder.
