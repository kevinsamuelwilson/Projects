In this project, engineered a train ETA prediction solution for a large Brazilian freight rail operator. The company operates 13,500 km of railway; 1,200 locomotives; and 33,000 wagons in a complex and largely single-tracked network. We were given raw, messy train traffic (time series) and train composition datasets which required significant data engineering, cleaning, and highly involved feature engineering. Based on 12 months of historical data used for training and testing, we implemented several models to predict estimated time of arrival for new data. Our most successful models were a multi-layer perceptron and histogram-based gradient boosted tree model. Our approach led to significantly higher prediction accuracies than the company's existing methodology.
